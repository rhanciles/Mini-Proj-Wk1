# Mini-Proj-Wk1

## Landing Page

### Description
Designing a landing page from scratch is my first Mini-Project after week 1 as a ‘Bootcamp’ student. Even though this is a single webpage for a client who wants to use it to collect visitor information.  Adding a contact form, image with caption, in addition to the many new things I’ve just learnt is taking me way beyond my comfort zone. I’ll definitely be chuffed if I can pull this off.

### Usage
Fingers crossed, by the time you interact with this page, you will be able to do the following:
  1.	Access the page from a web browser and interact with it like any other.
  2.	Click on the menu links and the page jumps directly to that section, especially the contact form.
  3.	Fill in your details and click to send. Just in case the question pops up in your mind, I think the info is going to the cloud somewhere. But please don’t take my word for it. :)

This repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task.  The content comprise only that related to the challenge; all other materials are removed for obvious reasons.

### Feedback
Please feel free to reach out or drop a comment here if you have any questions, queries or suggestions. Otherwise, you can find me on the Slack platform Pod 5, just search for Rod.
